#for i in range(11):
#    print(i)

# comment 1:"for i in range" this is named *for cycle* range = range can choise printing number example: for i in range(10). will return numbers from 0 to 9(not 10 because we have a *indexing*)

# comment 2:"why did we need *for cycle*?" for cycle will help u so it's make's your code more simple, example: you don't need to type this stupid
# print(1) print(2) and more.
